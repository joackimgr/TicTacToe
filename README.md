# TicTacToe
A browser-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

This project focuses on writing clean, modular JavaScript using Factory Functions and the Module Pattern to minimize global scope pollution and separate game logic from DOM manipulation.

## ✨ Features
Local PvP: Play against a friend on the same device.

Win & Tie Detection: Automatically announces the winner or a tie game.

Restart Functionality: Reset the board without reloading the page.

Dynamic Rendering: The game board is rendered using JavaScript and updated via DOM manipulation.

State Management: Prevents further moves once the game is over.
